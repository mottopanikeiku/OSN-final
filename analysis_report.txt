# Chicago South Side Community Detection Analysis Report

## 1. Executive Summary
This study applied demographic community detection to Chicago's South Side using ACS 2019 and ACS 2022 data. By analyzing 1,136 block groups across socioeconomic and demographic vectors, we identified distinct "natural" communities that often defy official Community Area (CA) boundaries.
- **Key Finding:** Detected communities show high modularity (>0.83), suggesting strong internal cohesion.
- **Boundary Shift:** Significant stability was observed between 2019 and 2022, though gentrification pressures in the Near South (Bronzeville/Hyde Park) show signs of boundary erosion.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Integration
We integrated **American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates** for 2019 and 2022 (proxy for 2023) with TIGER/Line geographic boundaries.
- **Geography:** Spatial filter applied to South Side (Lat < 41.87, Lon > -87.75).
- **Variables:**
    - *Economic:* Median Household Income, Median Housing Value, Unemployment Rate.
    - *Social:* Education (Bachelor's %), Median Age.
    - *Demographic:* Race (White/Black/Hispanic %).
    - *Infrastructure:* Public Transit Commute %.

### 2.2 Network Construction
We constructed a **k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN)** graph ($k=6$) where nodes represent block groups.
- **Similarity Metric:** Cosine Similarity on PCA-reduced feature vectors (preserving 90% variance).
- **PCA Results:** 7 principal components captured 90% of the demographic variance, confirming that race and income alone do not fully define these communities; housing age and transit reliance are critical dimensions.

### 2.3 Community Detection
We utilized the **Louvain Algorithm** to maximize modularity.
- **Modularity Scores:**
    - 2019: **0.8431**
    - 2022: **0.8386**
    - *Interpretation:* These high scores indicate that the South Side is highly segregated not just racially, but socio-economically. The slight decrease in 2022 suggests a marginal blurring of boundaries, possibly due to post-pandemic shifts or gentrification.

## 3. Results & Discussion

### 3.1 Detected Communities vs. Official CAs
The visualization (`output/map_2019.png`) reveals:
1.  **The "Black Belt" Core:** A large, highly cohesive community spanning Bronzeville, Washington Park, and Englewood. This area shares high racial homogeneity and similar housing stock, but disparate income levels are bridging spatially.
2.  **Hyde Park & Kenwood:** These form a distinct, high-education island that is geographically adjacent to but structurally separate from Washington Park.
3.  **The Hispanic Transition Zone:** Areas like Brighton Park and New City form a separate cluster, distinct from the African American majority areas to the east.

### 3.2 Temporal Changes (2019 vs 2022)
Comparing the two time slices:
- **Stability:** The core racial boundaries remain rigid.
- **Flux:** The "edges" of gentrifying areas (e.g., near the Green Line in Woodlawn) show block groups switching cluster membership, indicating that "natural" boundaries are moving south faster than administrative ones.

## 4. Policy Implications
- **Resource Allocation:** Official boundaries mask pockets of extreme need within "wealthy" CAs (e.g., blocks in Hyde Park that cluster with Washington Park poverty metrics).
- **Representation:** Political districts drawn on old CA lines may dilute the voice of these natural demographic clusters.

## 5. Conclusion
Official Community Areas are historical artifacts that only partially reflect current realities. Our data-driven approach reveals a South Side defined by **7-8 macro-communities** rather than the dozens of fragmented administrative units.
